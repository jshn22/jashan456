                <h3>Eternal University</h3>
                <p>Eternal university is NAAC Accredited & ISO 9001: 2015 Certified University established under the Himachal Pradesh Private University (Establishment & Regulation) Act 2006 & Himachal Pradesh Government Act.no. 3 of 2009, with the right to confer degree as per the UGC public notice on private Universities dated April 18, 2011.
                The great visionary of 20th century (Sant Attar Singh Ji) had a vision that modern scientific education alone will not serve the humanity well, until and unless it is amalgamated with Braham Vidya (Spiritual Education). The graduates of this unique education system will not only be outstanding in academics, but also will have high moral values (i.e. they will have love for humanity, compassion for the weak and the underdog, and sense of selfless service for the community). These graduates will work towards establishing permanent peace in the world. They will act as Ambassadors of Peace wherever they live, work and raise their families.

                <h3>Shri Badrika Ashram</h3>
                <p>The ashram was founded by the venerable saint Om Swami in 2011. After his intense tapas in the Himalayan caves and jungles, Swamiji decided to settle in a valley deep in the lap of Himachal to revive the dormant practices of Dhyana Yoga and Mantra Sadhana. Sri Badrika Ashram is the holy abode of Sri Hari.
                  Sri Badrika Ashram is a nonprofit organization that works towards serving the community at large and the villages that surround it. Swamiji’s simple mantra of, Live, Love, Laugh, Give is the very basis of all endeavors at the ashram.</p>
